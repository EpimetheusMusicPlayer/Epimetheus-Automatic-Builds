# Epimetheus automatic builds

This repository contains builds of Epimetheus that are automatically built after each commit.

The branches correspond to the branches of the [main Epimetheus repository](https://github.com/EpimetheusMusicPlayer/Epimetheus).

The 10 latest builds are kept in the commit history; after that, they're removed to save resources.
